        Incorporated a photoresistor to detect ambient light levels.

        Implemented logic to automatically turn on/off an LED based on light conditions, demonstrating environmental automation.

        Combined distance sensor logic with automated lighting for a more comprehensive smart home system.

💻 Code Examples & Logic

While the original code files are no longer available, the core logic implemented for this project is described below, demonstrating foundational programming and automation principles. The logic was derived from the project's original design and output.
Module 4 - Door Sensor Logic

    Input: Digital read from a door sensor (simulating a reed switch).

    Logic:

        If the door sensor detects a "closed" state, a green LED is illuminated, and the buzzer remains off, indicating no security threat.

        If the door sensor detects an "open" state, red and yellow LEDs are illuminated, and the buzzer is activated, signaling a security alert. A message "Door is open. Security Alert!" was printed to the Serial Monitor.

    Output: Visual (LEDs), audible (buzzer), and serial monitor alerts.

Module 6 - Distance Sensor & Automated Light Logic

    Inputs:

        Ultrasonic distance sensor (for proximity detection).

        Photoresistor (light sensor, for ambient light levels).

    Logic (Automated Light):

        Reads the analog value from the photoresistor.

        If the light level exceeds a predefined threshold, an automated light (LED) is turned ON, simulating a room being illuminated when it gets dark.

    Logic (Distance Sensor):

        Uses the ultrasonic sensor to measure distance.

        Alert Range: If an object is within a very close range (e.g., ≤ 12 inches), a "Possible Intruder" alert is triggered (e.g., red LED, buzzer activation).

        Warning Range: If an object is within an intermediate range (e.g., > 12 inches and ≤ 60 inches), a warning is indicated (e.g., yellow LED).

        Safe Range: If an object is beyond the warning range, a safe status is shown (e.g., green LED).

    Output: Visual (LEDs), audible (buzzer), and serial monitor alerts, with distance values also printed to the Serial Monitor.
